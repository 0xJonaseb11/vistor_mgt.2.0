# vistor_mgt.2.0

**(Visitor Management System v2.0)**

This project is a comprehensive Django-based application designed to demonstrate key data handling capabilities, including feature engineering, dataset management, and data preprocessing. The work aligns with quiz tasks such as:

1. Extracting large-scale data.
2. Dataset description.
3. Handling null values.
4. Data preprocessing.
5. Feature creation.

## Features
- **Return 500,000 Rows:** Efficiently manage large-scale datasets, enabling smooth retrieval of up to 500,000 rows.
- **Describe Dataset:** Provides detailed statistics and insights into the dataset, including types, distributions, and anomalies.
- **Handle Missing Values:** Locate and replace null values with suitable techniques (e.g., mean imputation, forward fill).
- **Data Preprocessing:** Perform essential preprocessing such as encoding categorical variables, normalization, and handling outliers.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features to enhance the model's performance or gain deeper insights into the dataset.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Django 4.x
- **Database:** SQLite (or any preferred database)
- **Languages:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, and other relevant Python packages.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Usage
- **Returning Large Rows:**
  Demonstrates efficient data handling for large-scale datasets with optimized queries and data processing.

- **Dataset Description:**
  Use the built-in data analytics tools to explore and understand the dataset.

- **Handling Null Values:**
  Flexible options to identify, replace, or drop null values based on user preferences.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  Provides pipelines for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation for analysis or machine learning models.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  Implement advanced techniques to generate meaningful features and improve data quality.
